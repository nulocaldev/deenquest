# Native Sponsor Integration Framework

## Overview
A comprehensive sponsor system that integrates seamlessly with DeenQuest's Islamic companion experience, providing value-driven partnerships rather than traditional advertising.

- No disruptive advertising or promotional messaging
- Contextually relevant to user's current activity
- Maintains the app's spiritual and educational focus

### 2. Value-First Approach
- Sponsors enhance user experience rather than interrupt it
- Focus on Islamic education, community, and spiritual growth resources
- Quality over quantity - curated, meaningful partnerships
- Mutual benefit for users, sponsors, and DeenQuest

### 3. Respectful Implementation
- Aligns with Islamic values and principles
- Transparent but unobtrusive presence
- User control and preference management
- Privacy-conscious data handling

  coordinates: { lat: 34.0522, lng: -118.2437 },
  timezone: 'America/Los_Angeles'
}
```

- User consent for location access
- Granular privacy controls
- Option to manually set location
- No personal location data stored
- Aggregated analytics only

1. **Precise Location**: Show neighborhood + city + state + country sponsors
2. **City Level**: Show city + state + country sponsors
3. **State Level**: Show state + country sponsors  
4. **Country Level**: Show country + global sponsors
5. **No Location**: Show only global sponsors

## Native Integration Patterns

### 1. Contextual Suggestions

```
Journal Page:
"Deepen your reflection with guided courses from Bayyinah Institute"

Cards Page: 
"Explore more wisdom from the Islamic Society of North America collection"

Games Page:
"Challenge yourself with advanced content from Al-Maghrib Institute"
```

### 2. Resource Enhancement

Local sponsors facilitate real-world connections:
- Nearby mosque finder

- Community service opportunities
- Educational class listings

### 4. Achievement Integration
Sponsors can provide achievement rewards:
- Digital certificates from educational partners
- Access to exclusive content
- Community recognition
- Real-world benefits (discounts, access)
